** step 1 ** 
The input needed from the client would be the 
- Signature 
- Transaction Call Data 
- PublicKey

where these 3 needs to be in decimal form. 

** step2 **
We would need to verify the signature that the siganture has been sign and send back bool. Once its done we need to generate a hashed public key to send back to the user so that everytime they need to do transaction just need to input that hashed public key.
